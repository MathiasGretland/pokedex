# Pokedex application using pokeapi!

## How the pokedex used to look when it first got created in 2022

## The old popover (using fontawesome for icons)

Created using create-react-app with JavaScript, using redux toolkit for fetching the pokeapi, used node-sass for styilng (even though we used some material components (didn't know you could just inline style them at that point hehe)), yeah and material components for tables.

This has now gotten a smaller makeover by converting to TypeScript, better logic for fetching the API, and completely removed the usage of SASS for CSS, but the overall structure is written poorly. Should reconsider rewriting the whole logic.
